                    <p class="main-left">With Proactive Maintenance, our servers will “watch” your SQL Servers for any issues or warning signs. Our staff is sent an email and paged immediately so we can resolve the issue before it becomes a problem; we react based on predefined directions. With open communications and clear escalation points, you will be aware of any and all situations. Our servers watch for failed jobs as well as jobs that run longer or shorter than normal. Not only do we watch for job abnormalities, but performance abnormalities as well. If your servers become too busy or your disks are working too hard, we will start troubleshooting by running a trace immediately and automatically. Troubleshooting begins before anyone logs on to the server. </p>


                    <p class="main-left">A professional service with a personal touch, our staff will quickly integrate with your team. Our Pro-Active Maintenance client has a Primary DBA and a Secondary DBA assigned to them. With our staff working closely with your staff, we will gain an indepth knowledge of your database and its inner workings. We can make recommendations that will improve your performance, stability and recoverability. Each one of our DBA’s will make sure that we recommend the best solutions for your company. They will evaluate and consider all aspects of your goals including timelines, budgets and requirements. </p>
