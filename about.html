                            <p class="main-left">“We had been experiencing serious performance issues on our website which our own back end team were unable to resolve. I contacted SQLonCall. Their experts reviewed our code and had an immediate recommendation. They rewrote 3 lines of code and the results were amazing! I would recommend them without reservation.”<br>

                            <p class="main-left">“SQLonCall is terrific... Our relationship started with a SQL Reports project.  We were so happy with the results that we have used them for other database projects that are beyond our expertise.” <br>

                            <br>
                            <p class="main-left">“SQL on call has been a lifesaver for our company! We needed our own SQL server but also required a qualified team of people that could operate it for us and do maintenance. They have been *extremely* helpful and patient while we got our server installed. After it was online he created the databases we wanted very fast. 

So far I have been very pleased with the service received and would recommend SQL on Call to anyone that needs a SQL database management team!” <br>
